#Decimal Input Test

Shows how to create ATM style input numerical input. This allows the user to input numbers one at a time and they're simply added to a fixed number of numbers and decimals. 

Length of string and number of decimal places can be changed by constants.

At the moment, only supports the period as a decimal separator. No localization is included.

Demo:

`0.00`
`0.01`
`0.12`
`1.23`
`12.34`
